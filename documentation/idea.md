# Train Builder - Project Concept

## Overview
Train Builder is a web-based transit network planning game where players design and build comprehensive train networks for cities. The game focuses on optimizing public transit to serve the population effectively.

## Core Gameplay
Players can:
- Build and expand train networks across the city
- View real-time population density per area
- Monitor work availability and commuter patterns
- Optimize transit routes to convert car drivers to train users

## Population & Transit Visualization

The game uses a color-coded system to visualize how citizens commute:

### Color Coding System
- **Red**: Drivers (car users)
- **Green**: Walkers
- **Blue**: Train users
- **Purple**: Bike users

### Game Objectives
- **More Blue** = More people using public transit 
- **Less Red** = Fewer car drivers 

The goal is to design train networks that maximize blue (transit users) and minimize red (car dependency) by providing efficient, accessible public transportation.

## Key Features
- Real-time population density mapping
- Work availability zones
- Dynamic commuter behavior based on transit accessibility
- Network optimization challenges
- Visual feedback on transit effectiveness

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Build Tool: Vite
